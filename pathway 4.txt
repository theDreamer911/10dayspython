Why we need build function
  When we build a program we maybe get hundred or thousand, to make it cleaner build our function
  
Give two line break after write function to make it cleaner

def greet():
    print('Hi There')
    print('Welcome Aboard')


greet()
---

print() take any input
greet() don't take any function

parameter vs argument
parameter : the input that we define in a function
argument  : the value for given parameter

Type function
1) perform a task
2) return a value

round(1.9) -> return a value

a function default value is none- it can be found as absensce of a value


tupples and list = collection of variable
different tupples can't be changed

xargs
def multiply(*numbers):
    # print(numbers)
    total = 1
    for number in numbers:
        # print(number)
        # total = total * number
        total *= number
    return total


print(multiply(2, 3, 4, 5))

the logic is the tupples will itterate and times to the total, after that, total will multiple again- in the end will output the answer

xxargs --> to make arguments can take parameter from user and save it into dictionary


global isn't python way, so if we can avoid for using it, avoid it
