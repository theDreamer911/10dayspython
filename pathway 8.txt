Concept in programming
we should separte our code into modules modules
  just like supermarket
  
High related sequence = module must be the same 

so we separete into file file
just like app.py and sale.py

in app.py we want to take one module from sale.py 
  to do that
  
from sale import module1, module2, ...

sale = the name of file
module1 = class inside the file that dedicated, we can use *, but that was a bad practice

another way

import sale
sale.module1

because inside the sale it will be a method
