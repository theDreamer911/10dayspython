Why we use regular expressions
	<> Make easier to find date and time
	<> Find email that valid
	<> Verify phone number and find the countery to which it belongs
	<> Make changing / replace data to be easier
	Can be used in multiple programming language

what are regular expressions
	Special text string for describing a search pattern, 
	
==DATA==
NameAge = """
	Jenice is 22 and Theon is 33 Gabriel is 44 and Joey is 21
"""

==REGEX==
It turns into dictinary that contain, like this
  {'Janice': '22', 'Theon':'33', 'Gabriel':'44','Joey'::'21'}

==How it Works==
First letter of all the names is an uppercase letter and Age is represented by numbers

ages = re.findall(r'\d{1,3}', NameAge)
names = re.findall(r'[A-Z][a-z]*', NameAge)

--
Both the string and RegEx have theri own cursor
if we put something in regex, the program will check the text, which one is the right one, so it will put it in regex


basic regular expressions operations
  <> Find a word in a string
  <> Generate an iterator
  <> Match one of any of several letters --> match words with a particullar pattern
  <> Match series of range of characters  --> match series of range of characters
  <> Replace String   --> Replace a string
  <> Match a Single Character   
		\b: backspace
		\f: formfeed
		\r: carriage return
		\t: tab
		\v: vertical tab
		
		
		===
		\d: match any any number
		\D: anything but a number
		===
		kalo pake \d nanti angkanya keluar, kalo \D gak keluar 
		--> digunaiin pas cari angka dimenit 31 an video
