create custom class
class = blueprint for creating new objects
object = instance of a class

class: human
objects: John, Mary, Jack

class rule:
use first character uppercase and separated with underscore

__init__ : magic method

instance is an attribute that belong to point instances or point object

all human has two eyes and two ears, 
Attribute define on class level
  on object reference we can use it
    if change class level value, we change all object that reference on it
	
	
	
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y


point = Point(1, 2)
other = Point(1, 2)
print(point == other)


the answer will be false, because it check the memory references. To compare it, we need a magic method


unpythonic is not using a best practice of python when coding

let's use property



Inheritance
  The concept of make some general method in one place, so it will not repeated
    
Two => inheritance & composition
DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself


The Object Class
isinstance() -> if an object is an instance of an class

Every class in python is directly or indirectly isinstance with object class


Method Overriding --> REPLACING OR EXTENDING THE METHOD DEFINE IN THE BASE Class

Multi Level Inheritance, too much of good thing is a bad thing, and that's very true in inheritance
  because too much inheritance can make new several issues

Employee -> person -> livingCreature -> Thing

That's very bad, because just because an employee is person, and a person is livingCreature doesn't mean every man must have class like that

LIMITED THE Inheritance in one or max two

---
Multiple inheritance --> if not use properly it will make bug
  it can be bad if we don't use it properly
    if a class doesn't have everything in common, this is good

Good Example of inheritance :
1) Don't have multilevel inheritance
2) Actually it's okey, but to avoid bug
3) Don't have multiple inheritance  


Abstract Base Class:
1) Make a subclass to access the base class, becoz it will make easier to understand

-> abstract base class is a half bake cookie
        it doesn't already to be eaten
		  purpose to provide common code to it's derivates
