create custom class
class = blueprint for creating new objects
object = instance of a class

class: human
objects: John, Mary, Jack

class rule:
use first character uppercase and separated with underscore

__init__ : magic method

instance is an attribute that belong to point instances or point object

all human has two eyes and two ears, 
Attribute define on class level
  on object reference we can use it
    if change class level value, we change all object that reference on it
	
	
	
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y


point = Point(1, 2)
other = Point(1, 2)
print(point == other)


the answer will be false, because it check the memory references. To compare it, we need a magic method
